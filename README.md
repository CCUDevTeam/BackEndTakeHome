## Welcome

The following exercise is to build a web API for a simple todo list app. Our team uses the controller-service-repository pattern, and the project has been set up accordingly. The primary task is to complete the controller (`API`) and service (`BLL`) layers, though you may also alter the pre-written repository (`DAL`) layer.

Feel free to add automated tests, design documents, or any other features in order to showcase your skills or experience in these areas. As your time is valuable, we ask that you don't spend an exorbitant amount of time on the exercise.

Recommended completion time: *1hr or less*
